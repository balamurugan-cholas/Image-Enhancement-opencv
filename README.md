## üß™ Available Filters

| Filter           | Description                                        |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Gaussian Blur     | Applies a Gaussian kernel for smooth blur         |
| Median Blur       | Reduces noise while preserving edges              |
| Bilateral Filter  | Smooths while keeping edge sharpness              |

Each filter can be adjusted by intensity input on the frontend.
